# Data Cleanup and Insights Portfolio

Hi there! We're Muge (MSc in Artificial Intelligence & Cognitive Science) and Ata (BSc in Artificial Intelligence & Cognitive Science), an AI duo based in the Netherlands that enjoys turning messy spreadsheets into decision-ready insights.

This repository houses synthetic-yet-realistic portfolio examples that mirror the way we support clients on Upwork/Fiverr: start with untidy CSV/Excel files, clean them with transparent pandas code, add just-enough exploratory analysis, and finish with plain-English takeaways plus exportable clean files.

## What we do

- Clean messy CSV/Excel data (types, missing values, duplicates, odd strings)
- Run focused exploratory data analysis to surface quick insights
- Deliver tidy CSV outputs ready for hand-off
- Share reproducible notebooks/scripts so work can be audited or extended
- Provide short reports in non-technical language

## Contents

- `01 – Clean Dataset`: A lightweight example showing how we standardise a customer list (countries, newsletter flags, unrealistic ages, duplicates) and export a ready-to-use file.
- `02 – Clean + Insight Pack`: A fuller walkthrough that combines sales-data cleaning, revenue-focused EDA with matplotlib charts, and a concise report aimed at business stakeholders.
